# Creating a new Project in R

:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Tip: If on a uni computer sign into OneDrive**
:::

Before you do this challenge make sure you have decided where you will save your R project. If you are on a university computer saving it in the cloud on your uni onedrive will mean you can access it later. Check you are signed into your uni one drive: open the file explorer > C drive > Users > find your username > OneDrive - University of Leeds and sign in. 

::::


> **Challenge 1**
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "New Project".
> 4. Type in the name of your project, e.g. "Learning_R".
> 5. Browse to choose where you want to save it.
> 6. Click the "Create Project" button

For future computer labs, if you want to open this same RStudio project now it has been created, click
through your file system to get to the directory where it was saved and double
click on the `.Rproj` file. This will open RStudio and start your R session in the
same directory as the `.Rproj` file. Any data, plots or scripts can be saved and 
retrieved from this directory.  

RStudio projects have the added benefit of
allowing you to open multiple projects at the same time each open to its own
project directory. This allows you to keep multiple projects open without them
interfering with each other.

<br>

## Best practices for project organization

In the bottom right pane in RStudio, click the "Files" tab. To organise your project, create folders called `data`, `scripts`, `results`, `docs` by clicking the folder icon with the green plus sign. 

<br>

### Use a script

The most effective way to work with R is to write the code you want to run in an .R script. You then run the selected lines (by either using a keyboard shortcut or clicking the "Run" button) in the R console.

Open a script (click the white square with the cross in green below File at the top left). Save the script in your R project folder (click "File", then "Save as" and browse to the `script` folder in your project). You could call it Lesson 1.

<br>

### Save the data in the data folder

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Three cartoon penguins with chinstrap, gentoo and adelie written above them."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/lter_penguins.png")
```

> **Challenge 2**
> View the palmer penguins data [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acriach/r_teaching/main/data/penguins.csv).
>
> 1. From the window showing the data, save the data as a file (CTRL + S or right mouse click > "Save as")
> 2. Make sure it's saved under the name `penguins.csv`
> 3. Save the file in the `data` folder within your project.

<br>

## Reading in data


Remember that the .csv data file is now saved in our data folder (do the same when you work with your own datasets).

We can load this into R via the following:

```{r}
penguins <- read.csv(file = "data/penguins.csv")
```

Here we used the function `read.csv` but there are lots of different functions for reading in different types of files. For example `read_excel` in the readxl package. 

:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Tip: Problems reading in data**
:::

If your spreadsheet won't read in check:  
1. You are using the correct function for the type of file, for example <kbd>`read.csv`</kbd> for csv files  
2. You have included the suffix after the name of the file  
3. The name of the file is spelled correctly  
4. The file exists in the folder you are directing R to. For example, in our case we would click on the folder named data under the files tab at the bottom right of RStudio to check.   
5. Look at an example on the internet to ensure you have included all the necessary arguments. <kbd>`read.csv`</kbd> only needs <kbd>`file =`</kbd> but other functions may need other arguments.  

::::


<br>


Once data is in R, you can view it by clicking on it's name under the Environment window.  

In R, datasets are called data frames (df) or sometimes tibbles.  

We can begin exploring our data frame right away, pulling out columns by specifying
them using the `$` operator:

```{r}
penguins$species
penguins$bill_length_mm
```

<br>

Passing the `penguins` data frame through the structure function `str` will show you the type of data for each variable.

```{r}
str(penguins)
```


'str' shows us that species is `chr` which is short for character. This means R will treat species as a factor (in other words, discrete data). Bill_length_mm is `num` which stands for numeric. `int` means integer. Both `num` and `int` variables are treated as continuous (scale) data by R.

<br>

We can calculate the mean of bill length.
```{r}
mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

But we can't use the mean function on a factor.
```{r, warning=TRUE}
mean(penguins$species, na.rm = TRUE)
```

:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Tip: When functions won't work**
:::

Sometimes R errors are caused by R treating a variable as a factor when you know it's a number. Checking what R is "thinking" with <kbd>`str`</kbd> can help.

::::

<br>

## Indexing (square brackets)

The `$` operator will specify a variable in a data frame. You can also use indexing.

> **Challenge 3**
>
> There are several subtly different ways to call variables, observations and
> elements from data.frames using indexing:
>
> Try out these examples and after a # in your script describe what data is returned by each one.
>
> - `penguins[1]`
> - `penguins[1, 1]`
> - `penguins[, 1]`
> - `penguins[1, ]`


<details>
  <summary>**Solution to Challenge 3**</summary>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins[1]
```

Calls the data in column 1.

<br>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins[1, 1]
```
Calls the information that is in the first row, first column. 

<br>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins[, 1]
```

Also, calls the first column.

<br>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
penguins[1, ]
```

Calls the first row.

## Getting help with coding


:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Tip: Help files**
:::

One of the most daunting aspects of R is the large number of functions available. It would be prohibitive, if not impossible to remember the correct usage for every function you use. Luckily, there are many sources of help!  

::::

<br>

### Using Gen AI to get help with coding

Gen AI can give you the specific help you need when your code won't work or when you are trying to do something new in R. It is recommended that you use copilot which the university provides for all staff and students. The data you enter into this version of copilot is not shared and therefore more secure.

If you want to use GenAI go to https://uoldigital.net/copilot and use your university username and password to sign in.

<br>

:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Don't rely solely on AI**
:::

You have to know the basics of R so that you can understand the code AI suggests. This means you can identify when GenAI hasn't quite understood your prompt and why the code it is giving you isn't working.

Try to avoid using code written by Gen AI and then getting into a spiral by repeatedly asking it to debug that code.  

::::

<br>

GenAI is only as good as the prompt you provide. Here's some tips

* Make sure your prompt includes the names of your variables and dataframe. 
* You can paste the code or error message in as part of your prompt if you are trying to de-bug.
* Ask it to use specific functions if you have a rough idea.
* Be specific: the prompt "use indexing on a dataframe called penguins" is less likely to help you than "select the first row of data from a dataframe called penguins using indexing".

<br>

The university has a guide for students on the use of [Gen AI in assessments](https://generative-ai.leeds.ac.uk/ai-and-assessments/). Your assessment must include a section similar to the below.

**Acknowledgement**

I acknowledge the use of Copilot (https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) to debug R code when cleaning and analysing my data.

<br>

### Getting help without Gen AI

Every package author writes help files for their functions. Each help page is broken down into sections (Description, Usage, Arguments etc). The last section Examples is very useful.  

Either of the commands below will bring up the help for the function `log`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?log
help(log)
```

<br>

When your code doesn't work: seek help from the R community. 9 times out of 10,
the answers you are seeking have already been answered on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

<br>

Other internet resources to look out for while googling are:

* [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
* [RStudio cheat sheets](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
* [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
