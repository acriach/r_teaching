## Making graphs with ggplot2

We will use the palmer penguin data to make graphs so check the "Environment" tab to make sure it is loaded into the R session. If it is not, then read it in.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
penguins <- read.csv(file = "data/penguins.csv")
```

There are different plotting systems in R for example,
the [base plotting system](http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/index.html). But the function `ggplot` in the [ggplot2 package](http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/ggplot2.html) is used by the majority of people.

To use it you will need to ensure you have the ggplot2 package installed (hint: use the Packages tab, bottom right) and then load it.
```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.alt="A hexagon with ggplot written in it and a zig zag line from left to right with some circles"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/ggplot2.png")
```

ggplot2 is built on the idea that any plot can be
made from the same set of components: a **data** set, a
**coordinate system**, and a set of **geoms** -- the visual representation of data
points.

The key to understanding ggplot2 is thinking about a graph in layers.

Let's start off with an example:

```{r bodyMassflipperLength-scatter, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

In the command we call the `ggplot` function. Any of the arguments we give the
`ggplot` function in the brackets following, will apply to all
layers on the plot.  

We've passed in two arguments to `ggplot`. First, we tell `ggplot` what data we
want to use to make the figure. In this example that is the penguins data we read in
earlier.   

For the second argument called mapping,  we passed in the `aes` function, which
tells `ggplot` how variables in the **data** map to *aesthetic* properties of
the figure. In this case the **x** and **y** locations. Here we told `ggplot` we
want to plot the "body mass" column of the penguins data frame on the x-axis, and
the "flipper length" column on the y-axis. 

By itself, the call to `ggplot` isn't enough to draw a figure:

```{r nogeom}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm))
```

We need to tell `ggplot` how we want to visually represent the data, which we
do by adding a **geom** layer. In our example, we used `geom_point`, which
tells `ggplot` we want to visually represent the relationship between **x** and
**y** as a scatterplot of points:

```{r bodyMass-vs-flipperLength-scatter, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

Here is one possible solution:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point()
```

Note: we can add arguments to geom_point to control the size, transparency and shape of the points.
```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.5, shape = "diamond")
```

  <summary>**Solution to Challenge 2**</summary>

Here is one possible solution:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```
</details>

<br>

We can make other types of graph using other **geoms**. If we wanted to compare body mass among the penguin species we might use a boxplot. We can change the `geom` to do this:

```{r bodyMassSpecies}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Tip: ggplot cheat sheet**
:::

There is a [ggplot cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf) to download which you can look at to see what the geoms are for common types of graph, as well as other ggplot code.  

Note that the layers on the cheat sheet have single letters and a `+` to represent the rest of the code for the graph. 
::::

<br>

## Layers

If we want boxplots with data points on top to visualise the spread of the data, we can
add another layer to the plot. `geom_jitter()` is good for this because it does not plot the points in one vertical line but randomly spreads them out:

```{r boxplotJitter}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter()
```

<br>

More layers can be added to control the way a graph looks. For example, we can change the axes labels:
```{r boxplotLabs}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Body Mass (g)")
```

<br>

We could use lots of layers to control the background, gridlines, axis lines. However, using a theme instead does this in one layer. `theme_classic()` gives styling that might be found in a scientific journal.
```{r boxplotPoints}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Body Mass (g)") +
  theme_classic()
```

>

  <summary>**Solution to Challenge 3**</summary>

Here is one possible solution:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = sex, y = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_violin()
```

Note: when we learn about data wrangling we will go through ways of removing data points like the penguins that had NA under sex.

## Colour

We previously used colour in aes to give each species a different colour:
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Putting the `colour = species` in the aes function in the **geom** layer also works:
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = species))
```

However, if we want to specify that all points should be a blue colour, oppose to levels in a variable being different colours, we use `colour =` but outside the `aes` brackets:
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(colour = "blue")
```
Note the word blue is put in "speech marks".

<br>

> ** Challenge 4**
>
> Choose a colour from this 
> [website that lists R colours](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/awesome-list-of-657-r-color-names/) 
> and create a **violin plot** of that colour which shows the difference in **body mass** among **species**. You can

<details>
  <summary>**Solution to Challenge 4**</summary>

Here is one possible solution:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_violin(colour = "darkorchid")
```

Note: adding `fill = "purple"` will add a colour to the inside of the violin.
```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_violin(colour = "darkorchid", fill = "darkorange")
```
</details>  

<br>

This graph uses default colours:
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Body Mass (g)") +
  theme_classic()
```

To specify colours, use `scale_colour_manual`:
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Body Mass (g)") +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"))
```

<br>

:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Tip: creating plots**
:::

When creating graphs people adapt code from the internet by replacing the names of the data and variables in the example code with their data.  

If searching for ggplot layers that will control specific parts of your graph, using the correct graph terminology helps. For example, tick marks, levels, error bars, axes, legends.

## Plotting statistics

ggplot2 also makes it easy to overlay statistical models on the data:
```{r billLengthDepth, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```

We can fit a trend line to the data by adding another layer,
`geom_smooth`:
```{r billflipper, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
Note: the `lm` stand for linear model and is the function used to do a linear regression.

We can also do this after the data has been split by **species** using `group`:
```{r billflippergroup, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, group = species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

<br>

> ## Challenge 4
>
> Make a **scatterplot** of **bill length** and **bill depth**, grouped and coloured by **species**, with **trendlines** for each species and **triangles** for points and **specify colours** (you can choose colours). Give it appropriate axes **labels** and a **classic theme**.
 

<details>
  <summary>**Solution to Challenge 4**</summary>

Here is one possible solution:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species, grouped = species)) + 
  geom_point(shape = "triangle") +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```
</details>

## Exporting plots

The `ggsave()` function allows you to export a plot created with ggplot. You can specify the dimension and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments (`width`, `height` and `dpi`) to create high quality graphics for publication.  
In order to save a plot from above, we first assign it to a variable, we could call it `penguin_plot`:

```{r save}
penguin_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species, grouped = species)) + 
  geom_point(shape = "triangle") +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

Now we can tell `ggsave` to save that plot in our `results` folder, with the file name "billScatterplot", in `png` format and specify the width and height in cm and the resolution (dpi). Check you have a `results/` folder in your working directory by clicking the files tab in the bottom left pane.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(filename = "results/billScatterplot.png", plot = penguin_plot, width = 12, height = 10, dpi = 300, units = "cm")
```
